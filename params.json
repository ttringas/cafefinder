I had a lot of fun, but I was also quite serious about staying productive and getting work done. Every time I went to a new city I had a mad scramble to find a suitable cafe for doing work. A good cafe has the following:\r\n* Fast (preferably free) Wifi\r\n* Power Outlets\r\n* Plenty of comfortable seating\r\n* Food & Restrooms\r\n* And most importantly a freelancer-friendly vibe where you won't get glared at for hanging around for a few hours.\r\n\r\n### Contribute Your Own Suggestions\r\nFill out the form below and I'll do a quick double-check and add your suggestion to the map.
